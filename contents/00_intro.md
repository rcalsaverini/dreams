# Dreams of an Analytics Platform

Last night I had a crazy dream. I dreamed about the future, and this document describes what I saw. It wasn't a mystical experience, it was just an Analytics Platform. But it was so easy to use, it made so much sense and it was so useful that I felt it was my obligation to describe it so that we can be inspired by it. I'll describe how I saw people using it in my dream, and what they told me about how it worked.

## Why did you wrote this?

This is an experiment and work in progress. I believe that software needs to be idealized and designed with a strong vision of what the end user needs, and it is my perception that current data platforms are not built this way. They are usually thought from the perspective of the backend engineers that needs to solve a problem. In this process usability and jobs the user needs to do are frequently relegated to afterthoughts. Because of this I decided to write about what I, both as an end user of an analytics platform and a software engineer, would like to see in a perfect world.

## Who is this for?

Anyone interested in how to build a better analytics platform. This is a work in progress, and I'm not sure if it will ever be finished. I'm writing it as I go, and I'm writing it for myself. I'm writing it because I want to understand what I saw in my dream, and I want to understand how we can build it in real life. I'm writing it because I want to learn from the dream.

## Structure of the Book

This book is divided into three parts:

- **Dreaming**. This is where I describe my dream. I'll describe how I saw people using the Analytics Platform in my dream, and what they told me about how it worked.
- **The AnaLog Language** This is where I describe the language used in the day-to-day of analysts using the Platform.
- **Building**. This is where I describe how we can build the Analytics Platform. I'll describe how we can build the Analytics Platform in real life, and what we can learn from the dream.
