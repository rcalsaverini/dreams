# Dreams of an Analytics Platform

Last night I had a crazy dream. I dreamed about the future, and this document describes what I saw. It wasn't a mystical experience, it was just an Analytics Platform. But it was so easy to use, it made so much sense and it was so useful that I felt it was my obligation to describe it so that we can be inspired by it. I'll describe how I saw people using it in my dream, and what they told me about how it worked.
