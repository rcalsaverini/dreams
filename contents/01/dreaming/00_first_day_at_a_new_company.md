# First Day at a New Company

My dream started at an office, with a lot of people working. I was there to start a new job. This was a dream job, quite literally, at the company with the most advanced Analytics Platform ever built. I was going to be a developer, and I was going to work on the Analytics Platform itself!

As such, my first assignment was to meet groups of people that used the Platform on their day to day work and note how it worked from the client's perspective.
